This project is a Full Stack MERN application meant to make a teacher's life easier to handle, by giving out homework for students and being able to check homework on that same app.. no missed emails, no faulty loadups, no missing attachments.
This App uses a frontend and backend.
https://trello.com/b/Xxj0trJc/base-mern is my Trello board for my inspiration
My unsolved issues are that after I added authentication as a reach goal... it was wrong and has taken down the rest of the application
Future features will be to get authentication working.
